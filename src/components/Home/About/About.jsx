                                I earned my degree in computer science and engineering from East West University. I put a lot of effort into my
                                studies, consider things thoroughly, and get along well with individuals. I enjoy the challenging tasks that
                                require solving problems and developing new skills.

                                ðŸš€ I am enhancing my expertise in the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS) and have hands-on experience working directly with ReactJS to build responsive and interactive user interfaces. My technical skills also include working with frontend development, backend development, and creating efficient RESTful APIs.
